## This is a README file so read this first

1. For running just clone, put your email id, password, and the names of Universities or Companies which you want to send requests to and run the code.
2. You can also write 2 more lines to automatically read the names of Universities from a csv or txt file but I only had 10 so I did'nt bother to do that.
3. If you are doing the 2nd point remember to also add a random timer between sending requests which I have set to 3 secs or else you will get blocked after some time. Also send a pull request if you are doing so :)

Okay now do whatever you want.
